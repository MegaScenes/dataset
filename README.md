The MegaScenes Dataset is an extensive collection of around 430K scenes and 9M images and epipolar geometries, featuring over 100K structure-from-motion reconstructions from 2M of these images. The images of these scenes are captured under varying conditions, including different times of day, various weather and illumination, and from different devices with distinct camera intrinsics.
